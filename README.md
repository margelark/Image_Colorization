# Image Colorization

# Image colorization, the process of adding realistic colors to grayscale images, presents significant challenges in the field of computer vision. This paper details the efforts to develop a model capable of colorizing grayscale images by interpreting the task through classification, regression, and Generative adversarial networks. We propose a novel approach where each pixel in a grayscale image is classified into one of several color categories, similar to methods used in semantic segmentation. Our training utilizes the COCO dataset, with computational resources spanning local machines, and Google Colab, aiming to complete training within one day on a CPU. The efficacy of our model is assessed through user studies, where participants evaluate the colorization results either by comparison or by direct rating. This approach not only offers a practical solution to image colorization but also contributes to the broader understanding of applying classification techniques to complex image processing tasks.
